# Question Everything

## Me, me [me](https://github.com/voodoo/voodoo.github.io/wiki)!

I've been a full stack developer for more than 15 years. 

- See my [html](https://voodoo.github.io/resume) resume or [PDF](https://voodoo.github.io/Resume.pdf) resume.

- [Cover letter - (written by AI)](https://github.com/voodoo/voodoo.github.io/wiki/Cover-letter)

Ruby on Rails is my tool of choice, though lately I've been spending a lot of time with AI, AI prompts and Static site generators.

- My best asset is my **interest**
- I seek value - "how is this technology going to help me create value for myself and others?"
- Finding the right tool for the job used to be the hardest part. Now, choosing, the right tool is hardest because of paradox of choice.
- So I [choose people instead.](Looking-over-the-shoulders-of-giants)
- I've got 20 years of experience **choosing** and implementing the right tools for the job
