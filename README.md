# Me, me me!

I've been a full stack developer for more than 15 years.

Ruby on Rails is my weapon of choice, though lately I've been spending a lot of time with AI, AI prompts and Static site generators.

## Things I like (see my [wiki](https://github.com/voodoo/voodoo.github.io/wiki))

- web technologies of all sorts
- art - especially abstract
- [guitars](https://www.vudmaska.com/site-sharktail/) / music
- ancient history
- [solar](https://github.com/voodoo/static-solar-plan/tree/gh-pages)
- turtles
