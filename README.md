# Question Everything
-->

I've been a full stack developer for more than 15 years. 

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is my tool of choice, though lately I've been spending a lot of time with AI, AI prompts and Static site generators.

- My best asset is my **interest**
- I seek value - "how is this technology going to help me create value for myself and others?"
- Finding the right tool for the job used to be the hardest part.
  - Now, choosing, the right tool is hardest because of paradox of choice.
  - So I choose people instead.
  - [Looking-over-the-shoulders-of-giants.](https://github.com/voodoo/voodoo.github.io/wiki/Looking-over-the-shoulders-of-giants)
- I've got 20 years of experience **choosing** and implementing the right tools for the job
- Maybe you noticed the gap in my resume regarding Rails.
- I _blanking_ love Rails but for awhile I moved on to other things like Framer.
- Now I'm back at it deploying a Rails app with Fly.
- Rails is the bees knees and I'm happy to have picked it back up.
- Riding a bike and all that!
