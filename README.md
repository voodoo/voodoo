I've been a full stack developer for more than 15 years. 

- See my [resume](https://voodoo.github.io/resume)
- [Cover letter](https://github.com/voodoo/voodoo.github.io/wiki/Cover-letter)

Ruby on Rails is my weapon of choice, though lately I've been spending a lot of time with AI, AI prompts and Static site generators.

## Things I like

- web technologies of all sorts
- art - especially abstract
- [guitars](https://voodoo.github.io/site-sharktail/) / music
- ancient history
- [solar](http://voodoo.github.io/static-solar-plan)
- turtles
