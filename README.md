# Me, me me!

But enough about me, let me tell you something about me.

I'm a full stack developer and have been so for almost 15 years.

Ruby on Rails is my weapon of choice, though lately I've been spending a lot of time with AI, prompts and Static site generators.

## Things I like

- web technologies of all sorts
- art - especially abstract
- ancient history
- [solar](https://github.com/voodoo/static-solar-plan)
- turtles
